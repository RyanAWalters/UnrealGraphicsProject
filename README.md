This project is a 3D action game demo where the player must survive onslaughts of enemies. Luckily there are allies to aid you on your mission to scale the mountain and defeat the final boss. All you have is a sword and super-human agility.

*This game demo was created by myself and one other person in the span of 2.5 months as a side project in a class. It was created in Unreal Engine, and we used Git for version control.*

**I programmed the landscape and material, the particle effects like the snow on the mountain, and the ally and enemy AI. The landscape material is generated proceduarlly based on altitude (getting snowier the higher you get) and angle (making sheer cliff faces into rocks). The ally and enemy AI both extend from the same parent character AI class I wrote. Allies attack enemies and enemies attack allies (while preferring to target the player). AI will retaliate against attacks and attack AI who attack them.**
